Hi!

I’m a Rust enthusiast with a keen interest in object detection and its applications in security.

To sharpen my skills, I’ve built a basic object detection program in Rust as a learning project.

Currently, this only supports macOs, however, commenting out line 21 in main.rs fixes this.

I hope you enjoy exploring it!
